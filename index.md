When: **Tuesdays, 4:30&ndash;5:30pm**, Aug. 29&ndash;Dec. 5

Where: **Hillman Library, Rm. 255**. How to find it: turn left out of the elevator, then right. Walk towards the dark gray door, with the frosted glass on your right. Rm. 255 will be on your left.  

Users of R and RStudio are invited to bring their questions to this weekly, in-person office hour. Tutoring-style assistance is offered. If we don't know the answer, we'll help you look for it! Students, faculty, and staff are all welcome.

Example topics we have assisted participants with:

* base R (working with vectors, writing functions) 
* importing (e.g., from CSV) and cleaning data 
* table pivots and joins 
* determining and plotting an appropriate visualization of data 
* troubleshooting error messages 
* application of a statistical method in the R setting 
* figuring out a workaround to a non-functional package 

What you should bring: your laptop and your question/problem.
