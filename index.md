Users of R and RStudio are invited to bring their questions to this weekly in-person office hour. Tutoring-style assistance is offered. If we don’t know the answer, we’ll help you look for it! Students, postdocs, faculty, and staff are welcome.

Topics we can help with include:

* general R and RStudio questions; help getting started
* troubleshooting an error or bug in your code
* data wrangling, i.e., cleaning and manipulation, using dplyr and tidyr (tidyverse)
* data exploration and analysis using dplyr (tidyverse)
* data visualization using ggplot2 (tidyverse)
* general programming questions/advice as they relate to R
* (this is a growing list!)

What you should bring: your laptop and your question/problem.
