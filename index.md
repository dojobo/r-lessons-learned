When: **Tuesdays, 5-6pm**, starting August 30

Where: **Hillman Library, G-74** (Amy Knapp Room; straight back on the Ground Floor). I may also be available on Zoom if no in-person visitors are present ([zoom link](https://pitt.zoom.us/j/97200939890)).  

Users of R and RStudio are invited to bring their questions to this weekly in-person office hour. Tutoring-style assistance is offered. If we don’t know the answer, we’ll help you look for it! Students, postdocs, faculty, and staff are welcome.

Topics we can help with include:

* general R and RStudio questions; help getting started
* troubleshooting an error or bug in your code
* data wrangling, i.e., cleaning and manipulation, using dplyr and tidyr (tidyverse)
* data exploration and analysis using dplyr (tidyverse)
* data visualization using ggplot2 (tidyverse)
* writing functions and using a functional programming approach
* general programming questions/advice as they relate to R
* (this is a growing list!)

What you should bring: your laptop and your question/problem.
