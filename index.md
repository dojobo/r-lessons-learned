When: **Tuesdays, 5&ndash;6pm**, January&ndash;April

Where: **Hillman Library, Rm. 255**. How to find it: turn left out of the elevator, then right. Walk towards the dark gray door, with the frosted glass on your right. Rm. 255 will be on your left.  

Users of R and RStudio are invited to bring their questions to this weekly, in-person office hour. Tutoring-style assistance is offered. If we don't know the answer, we'll help you look for it! Students, faculty, and staff are all welcome.

Example topics we have assisted participants with:

* base R (working with vectors, writing functions)
* importing (e.g., from CSV) and cleaning data
* using tidyverse to examine and filter data
* plotting using ggplot2
* troubleshooting error messages
* figuring out a workaround to a non-functional package

What you should bring: your laptop and your question/problem.

This service is provided free of charge for the Pitt community by the [University Library System](https://library.pitt.edu/), [Digital Scholarship Services](https://library.pitt.edu/digital-scholarship-services/). For questions, contact the Library [here](https://library.pitt.edu/ask-us).
